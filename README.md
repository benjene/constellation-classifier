# constellation-classifier
Repo for final project of MAIS202 - Constellation Classifier

Project team members: Nicholas Foisy, Japmann Sarin, Fardin Abdullah

See Dataset.rar for the dataset collected and used by us. See Model.ipynb for a Colab notebook of our code.

You can download the code in the /flask/ folder to run the webapp locally, where a canvas element allows you to draw constellations and have them be classified in real time. Simply open the folder in a python command prompt and type 'flask run'.
